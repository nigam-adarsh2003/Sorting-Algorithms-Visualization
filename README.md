# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This repository contains a visualization tool for various sorting algorithms implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library. The project aims to help users understand and visualize the workings of different sorting algorithms through interactive animations.

## Introduction

Sorting Algorithms Visualization is an educational tool designed to help users learn and understand the mechanics of various sorting algorithms. By visualizing the step-by-step process, users can gain a deeper insight into the algorithms' behavior and efficiency.

## Features

* Visualization of multiple sorting algorithms
* Interactive controls for pausing, stepping, and restarting the visualization
* Adjustable speed settings for different levels of detail
* Customizable array sizes and element ranges

## Supported Algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* And more!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
* SDL2 library
